# Global Corona Pandemic Analysis Mini Project

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the history of mankind, there have been several pandemic situations.
Every time a new epidemic appears, mankind has been trying to find new vaccines and treatments. 
In each case, the most important role was to conduct reliable epidemiological investigations and transparently disclose the results.
Mankind created new vaccines and treatments based on publicly released data and tried to find a way until an alternative is available.
In the pandemic situation, various data analysis, such as how many people are currently infected? where are the regions where infected people are currently decreasing? what is the age and living environment where the number of infected people is high? and whether the number of infected people is decreasing due to the effectiveness of the vaccine? and data visualization for people to understand easier have ​made a lot of contributions.
Through this mini-project, we are also trying to get descriptive statistics on which countries have the highest number of infections based on the corona-related data available to the public.
The result will display the cumulative infection level on a map of the world so that anyone can check it at a glance.
We use the data from the [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccinations] database collected in real time by https://ourworldindata.org/
We can use the data required for practice in "./data//covid/covid-vaccination-doses-per-capita.csv”.
For reference, we need to understand that there are some data are excluded because some countries do not disclose the data to the world, but we can still practice with the data provided.
